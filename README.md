# README 

Figured I would use this as a repo to document and update where to find data for various different sports.

The goal is to make it a bit easier for people to find what the sports datat they are looking for. Feel free to put in a PR if you know or find of other sources. 

## Languages 

Feel free to add info on other languages etc. In the future, I (or we) can document where to find APIs.
